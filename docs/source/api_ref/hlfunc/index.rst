High-Level Functions
===============================

.. versionadded:: v1.1
    
.. warning:: 

    The high-level functions are still in beta mode. Functions are subject to changes in terms of naming and parameters.

HL-FUNC provides high-level abstraction functions on top of the object-oriented HL-API, aiming to help you simplify code logics and increase readability and maintainability.

HL-FUNC consists of sub-libraries where functions are grouped based on functionalities, such as :term:`ANLT<ANLT>`. Complex operation sequences are wrapped inside high-level functions, e.g. initiating link training, reserving ports, etc.
