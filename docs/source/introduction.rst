Introduction
====================

Xena OpenAutomation (:term:`XOA`) Python API is a standalone Python library that provides a user-friendly and powerful interface for automating network testing tasks using Xena Networks test equipment. Xena test equipment is a high-performance network test device designed for testing and measuring the performance of network equipment and applications.

The XOA Python API is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other automation tools and frameworks. It provides a comprehensive set of methods and classes for interacting with Xena test equipment, including the ability to create and run complex test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic at line rate, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior.

The XOA Python API simplifies the process of automating network testing tasks using Xena test equipment. It provides a simple, yet powerful, interface for interacting with Xena test equipment using the Python programming language. With the XOA Python API, network engineers and testing professionals can easily create and execute test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior, all while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Python programming language.

Overall, the XOA Python API is a valuable tool for anyone looking to automate their network testing tasks using Xena test equipment. With its simple, yet powerful, interface and support for the Python programming language, the XOA Python API provides a flexible and extensible framework for automating network testing tasks and improving the quality of network infrastructure.

The XOA Python API and `XOA CLI <https://docs.xenanetworks.com/projects/xoa-cli>`_ are both tools for automating network testing tasks using Xena test equipment, but they differ in several ways:

* Interface: The XOA Python API provides a Pythonic interface to interact with Xena test equipment, while the XOA CLI provides a command-line interface to interact with Xena test equipment.

* Programming: The XOA Python API is a library that can be used with the Python programming language to create and execute complex test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior. The XOA CLI is a standalone tool that can be used to interact with Xena test equipment through the command line, without the need for programming.

* Functionality: While both tools can be used to create and execute test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior, the XOA Python API provides a more comprehensive and flexible set of functions for interacting with Xena test equipment. The XOA CLI provides a subset of the functionality available through the XOA Python API.

* Ease of use: The XOA Python API provides a more user-friendly and intuitive interface for interacting with Xena test equipment, while the XOA CLI can be more complex and requires knowledge of the command line interface.

In summary, the XOA Python API is a library for programming with Xena test equipment, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly interface to interact with the equipment, while the XOA CLI provides a simpler command-line interface to interact with Xena test equipment, without the need for programming.
